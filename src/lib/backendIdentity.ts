/**
 * Which backend do this device's session caches belong to?
 *
 * Stored session ids are only meaningful to the backend that minted them, but
 * the device caches keyed by them are not: transcripts, drafts, the send
 * queue, chat marks, the stored-id map and the last-session pointer all
 * survive a re-pair, so a session id minted by machine A hydrates A's chat
 * contents after pairing to machine B (fully, on a lazy resume that returns
 * no messages) — and the queue/outbox flush would deliver A's unsent texts
 * into B's sessions as real prompts. This module fingerprints the CURRENT
 * pairing; when the fingerprint changes — or is missing, which counts as a
 * change so pre-existing installs re-scope once — every storedId-keyed cache
 * is re-scoped:
 *   - transcripts / marks / attention / session maps: PURGED. Server history
 *     re-hydrates on resume; the rest is device-local decoration.
 *   - drafts / send queue / outbox: SHELVED under the old fingerprint, never
 *     deleted — they are the user's own unsent words. Pairing back to that
 *     machine restores them (and their queues then flush to the right
 *     machine, which is where they were always meant to go).
